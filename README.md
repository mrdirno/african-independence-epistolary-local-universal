### Story Entry Points

- Write a letter from Ama to Nii, describing a day at the hospital where the 'mechanics' of the new nation are failing or succeeding.
- Compose Kwame's next aerogramme, written after he hears a specific piece of news about Ghana's independence from a London newspaper.
- Describe the first visitor to Nii's house who is not Ama—a neighbor, a local official, a stranger—and the conversation that unfolds on the veranda.
- Write the 'ghost-voice' of Nii's father, a memory or impression triggered by a specific object found in a drawer of the house.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map tracing the journey of the blue aerogramme from London to Accra, with layers showing postal routes, political borders of the time, and weather patterns.
- Create a 'Soundscape of Silence' generator that mixes ambient sounds from the novel (generator thrum, Aburi birds, bar chatter, coastal waves) allowing users to compose the 'sound' of a living or dying house.
